        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>My name is <a href="https://laurenkamm.github.io/img/Lauren_Photo.jpg">Lauren Kamm</a> (she/her), and I am a junior CTD major at the University of Colorado Boulder. I enjoy hiking, skiing, and cooking!  </p> 
        <p>My goal for this class is to gain website-making skills, and ultimately be able to create my own website to use as a portfolio.</p>
