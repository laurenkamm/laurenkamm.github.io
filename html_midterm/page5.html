    <h1>Errors Fixed</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The page was missing a doctype, so on line 1 I set the doctype to HTML</li>
            <li>The page was did not have a language specified, so on line 2 I set the language to english </li>
            <li>On Line 74, the paragraph end tag was incorrect because it was missing a slash, so inside the end tag I added a slash before the p </li>
            <li>On Line 80, the em end tag was incorrect because it was missing a slash and was spelled incorrectly so i changed it to "/em"</li>
            <li>Missing closing /html tag, so I added it at the end </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>On Line 25, the bold tag around "New Beehive Inn" has an incorrect end tag, so I added "/b" to the end tag</li>
            <li>On line 39, the hyperlink was a broken link, so I changed it to the correct wikipedia link</li>
            <li>On line 55, the hyperlink was typed out with spaces and didn't lead anywhere, so I changed it to the correct wikipedia link</li>
            <li>On Line 54, the h2 tags are inside the bold (b) tags, which is incorrect because header elements can't be a child of b elements. I fixed this by moving the b element tags inside the h2 tags. </li>
            <li>The formating of the headings/sub-headings was off because there was inconsistent sizes for the headings and the "closure" section was missing a thematic break after the heading. I changed the headings "Description", "History", and "Closure" to be a consistent size (H2), changed and added the hr tag after the "closure" heading. I also changed the sub-header "Interior" to H3 to better match the format of the wikepedia page. (In this case, bolding the header doesn't really change the apparence so the b element could just be deleted entirely).</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>In the table, the table data cell "Lily" had an incorrect end tag, so I added "td" inside the end tag </li>
            <li>On line 52, the list item tags were mispelled, so I changed the start and end tags from "l" to "li" to fix them. </li>
            <li>The name "Zabata" was tagged as a table header(th) when it should have been tagged as a table data cell(td), so I changed the tag from th to td.</li>
            <li>Some of the data cells were listed under the wrong table headers, so the table formatting was incorrect, so I moved the misplaced data cell lines to be under their correct table header section</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The doctype was not specified, so on Line 1 I set the doctype to HTML</li>
            <li>Line 36 was missing the end tag for table data cell, so I added /td at the end of the line</li>
            <li>Line 46 was missing the table data cell start tag, so I added the start tag (td) before the image link</li>
            <li>The orange cat image on Line 41 appeared above the table on the web page instead of being in the table with the other images because it was not was not never tagged as a table data cell, so I added the start (td) and end (/td) tags around the image link to add it to the table</li>
            <li>Added alt text for images</li>
        </ul>
